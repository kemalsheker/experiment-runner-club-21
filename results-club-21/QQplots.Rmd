This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}


# Define the path to the "results" folder
#results_folder <- "results"

 #Define the path to the "py-fp" folder within the "results" folder
#py_fp_folder <- file.path(results_folder, "py-fp")

# Define the path to the "arrayiteration" folder within the "py-fp" folder
#arrayiteration_folder <- file.path(py_fp_folder, "arrayiteration")

# Specify the name of the text file you want to read
#file_name <- "energy_totals.txt"

# Combine the folder paths and file name to get the full file path
#file_path <- file.path(arrayiteration_folder, file_name)


# Read the data from the text file (one value per line)
#data <- scan(file_path, what = numeric())

# Create a Q-Q plot
##qqnorm(data)
#qqline(data)




file_paths <- list(
  "results/py-fp/arrayiteration/cpu_averages.txt",
  "results/py-fp/bfs/cpu_averages.txt",
  "results/py-fp/bubblesort/cpu_averages.txt",
  "results/py-fp/dfs/cpu_averages.txt",
  "results/py-fp/fib/cpu_averages.txt",
  "results/py-fp/filter/cpu_averages.txt",
  "results/py-fp/matrix_mul/cpu_averages.txt",
  "results/py-fp/merge/cpu_averages.txt"
)

combined_data <- NULL  # Initialize an empty data frame or vector

for (file_path in file_paths) {
  data <- scan(file_path, what = numeric())
  combined_data <- c(combined_data, data)  # Combine data from each file
}


qqnorm(combined_data)
qqline(combined_data)





```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
